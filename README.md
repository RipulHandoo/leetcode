# LeetCode Solutions
This is a repository where I share my solutions to LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a platform for practicing coding skills by solving algorithmic problems. Each problem comes with a description, and the goal is to write code that solves the problem efficiently.

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems. I've organized the solutions by problem number, and each solution is in its own file. In the file, you'll find the problem statement, my thought process, and the code that solves the problem.

I've written the solutions in Java, but you can easily adapt them to other programming languages. Feel free to use these solutions as a reference or a starting point for your own solutions. However, I encourage you to try to solve the problems on your own before looking at my solutions.

If you find any errors or have a better solution to a problem, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome feedback and collaboration.

Happy coding!

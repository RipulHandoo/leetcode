# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

# Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

# Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
